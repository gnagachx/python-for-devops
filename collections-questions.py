1. Write a Python function proper_divisors(num) which returns a list of all the proper divisors of given number.
Example: Proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110
2. Write a Python function generate_fibonacci(n) to return a list of first n Fibonacci numbers.
3. Write a Python program to generate the next 15 leap years starting from a given year. Populate the leap years into a list and display the list.
4. Given a string containing uppercase characters (A-Z), compress the string using Run Length encoding. Repetition of character has to be replaced by storing the length of that run. Write a python function encode(message)  which performs the run length encoding for a given String and returns the run length encoded String. Provide different String values and test your program.
Example: message=AAAABBBBCCCCCCCC  output: 4A4B8C
5. Represent a small bilingual (English-Swedish) glossary given below as a Python dictionary
{"merry":"god", "christmas":"jul", "and":"och", "happy":"gott", "new":"nytt", "year":"ar"} 
and use it to translate your Christmas wishes from English into Swedish. That is, write a Python function translate(b_dict,list_words) that accepts the bilingual dictionary and a list of English words (your Christmas wish) and returns a list of equivalent Swedish words.

6. Write a python function, encrypt_sentence(msg) which accepts a message and encrypts it based on rules given below and returns the encrypted message.

Words at odd position -> Reverse It

Words at even position -> Rearrange the characters so that all consonants appear before the vowels and their order should not change

Note: Assume that the sentence would begin with a word and there will be only a single space between the words.

          Perform case sensitive string operations wherever necessary.

Example: msg=the sun rises in the east    output=eht snu sesir ni eht stea

7. Write a Python program to find the number of characters present the given string.

8. Write a Python program to find the numbers of words present in the given sentence.

9. Write a Python function words_count(sentence) to return a dictionary with the length of words as key and number words with such length as value.

Example: sentence=“I love python and it so easy to learn” sample output={1:1,4:2,5:1,3:1,2:3,6:1}

10. Write a Python function vowel_count(sentence) to return a dictionary with vowels, consonants, others as key and respective number of vowels, consonants, others characters as value.

Note: Do case insensitive operations

Example: sentence=“I love python and it so easy to learn”

                 sample output={“vowels”:12,”consonants”:17, “others”:8}
